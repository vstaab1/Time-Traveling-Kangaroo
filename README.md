# Time-Traveling Kangaroo
This is a simple boardgame-like program that uses the Pygame module. I set out to create a game starring a kangaroo. I wanted something similar to a boardgame--randomized elements combined with strategy. This game includes 20 event cards which take you around the board, 11 "shop items" which affect gameplay, and short animations to complement the primarily text-based format. The program responds to keyboard inputs to take your name, randomly pick event cards, and buy and use shop items; between input prompts, the program will display current "KangaCash" balance, run short animations, keep track of the current space, and display the shop when the user passes the shop spaces. Instructions are available to view at the beginning of the game.
