# Time-Traveling Kangaroo
This is a simple boardgame-like video game that uses the Pygame module. I set out to create a game starring a kangaroo, and this is what I came up with. 
Use your keyboard to help the kangaroo reach the end of time by picking up event cards and purchasing items from the shop.
